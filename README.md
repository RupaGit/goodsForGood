# goodsForGood
A community trading application that will help you get the goods you need when local stores have been wiped out.

## Description
The global pandemic of 2020 that affected billions of people all over the world created a situation where locating and purchasing essential items became difficult and dangerous. With Goods for Good, we wanted to create an environment where it is easy and safe to find essential items in your local community and trade with others. Goods for Good uses your location to show you local trades and lets you create and post your own trades. We hope you enjoy it and find the goods you need!
